# YouTube Notification System

This project implements a simple YouTube notification system using RabbitMQ, where YouTubers can publish videos, users can subscribe to YouTubers, and receive notifications for new videos.

## Features

- YouTubers can publish videos, which are then broadcasted to all their subscribers.
- Users can subscribe to YouTubers to receive notifications for new videos.
- Notifications are delivered in real-time using RabbitMQ message broker.

## Files

1. **YoutubeServer.py**: This script implements the server-side functionality of the YouTube notification system.
2. **Youtuber.py**: This script allows YouTubers to publish videos, which are then sent to subscribers.
3. **User.py**: This script enables users to subscribe to YouTubers and receive notifications for new videos.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- RabbitMQ
- Pika (Python RabbitMQ client library)

## Setup

1. Install RabbitMQ on your system.
2. Install Pika library using `pip install pika`.

## Usage

1. **YoutubeServer.py**: Run this script to start the server, which listens for video publication and user subscription messages.
2. **Youtuber.py**: YouTubers can run this script to publish new videos.
3. **User.py**: Users can run this script to subscribe to YouTubers and receive notifications.

## Instructions

1. Start the `YoutubeServer.py` script.
2. YouTubers should run the `Youtuber.py` script to publish videos.
3. Users should run the `User.py` script to subscribe to YouTubers and receive notifications.

## Example

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    python YoutubeServer.py
    ```

2. YouTuber publishes a video:
    ```bash
    python Youtuber.py
    ```

3. User subscribes and receives notifications:

    ```

## Note
